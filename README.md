# FoocAccessMachineLearning
This is a part of team work. Here I am responisble for establishing machien learning models to predict the relationship between the FoodAccess and housing median prices in California. 


## Data Source:
1. FoodAccess_link : https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/download-the-data/
2. CensusTact_link: https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=housing%20value&g=0400000US06%241400000_860XX00US90031&tid=ACSDT5Y2020.B25077

### Model comparision in progress
Linear regression, Polynomial regression, Decision Tree (regression model) and Random Forest (regression model) had been included. 
#### tools used in this model:
Data combined housing praice from Census Zillow
regression analysis for choosingcrtical features that contribute housing prices 
fixed signficant features from combined dataset
tried several models
    linear regression
    ploynomial regression (the worst one)
    Desicion Tree- regression model
    Randome Forest regression model
    Neural Network model
